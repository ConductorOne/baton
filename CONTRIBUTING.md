## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](./README.md).

### Where are things?

The Baton project lives over multiple git repositories.  To get started:
- [baton](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton): Baton Command Line tool, which can be used to explore data extracted by a connector.
- [baton-sdk](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-sdk): Primary Go SDK library, which contains many core behavoirs, data strcutures, and utilities. 
- `baton-X`, where X is a specific connector.  For example [baton-github](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-github) contains the implementation of a GitHub connector.  It leverages the `baton-sdk` repository as a dependency.

## Getting Started
